# **Fargin** 

---

## Brief Description
Fargin means to celebrate another's successes. Often times, we celebrate other's wins more so than our own. I'd like for people to celebrate their own successes no matter how small with the visualization of their own progress. This is a habit tracking app that currently lets you add habits and logs to each habit.
